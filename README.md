Just another sad ol' abandoned blog.
I wrote a [few things](https://github.com/ryonlife/ryonlife.com/tree/master/content/pages) at least.
This was backed by [Nesta](http://nestacms.com/), a CMS built on Sinatra and Ruby.
Content was up on [ryonlife.com](http://www.ryonlife.com) at some point.
Wonder if there's any goodness there now...
